<h3>Project Components:</h3>

<h4>Dataset:</h4>
CaptionCraft utilizes the SCICAP dataset, a comprehensive collection of scientific figures and their corresponding captions sourced from research papers spanning multiple disciplines. The dataset contains over 2 million figures across eight categories, including Computer Science, Economics, Mathematics, and Physics. By leveraging a random sample of 201 images from the SCICAP dataset, CaptionCraft ensures a representative selection of scientific visuals for training and evaluation purposes.

<h4>Data Preprocessing:</h4>
Prior to model training, CaptionCraft implements preprocessing techniques to clean and standardize the captions associated with scientific figures. This involves removing punctuation, single characters, and numeric values to ensure the clarity and coherence of the captioning data. Additionally, the figures are converted into uniform image formats with consistent dimensions to facilitate efficient processing and feature extraction.

<h4>Model Training:</h4>
CaptionCraft employs a sophisticated model architecture integrating Dense, Embedding, self-attention mechanisms, and vision transformers to generate captions for scientific figures. Through transfer learning, the model leverages pre-trained vision transformers to extract relevant features from the images, which are then tokenized and processed alongside the captions using advanced NLP techniques. The iterative training process involves fine-tuning the model on the SCICAP dataset to optimize caption generation performance.

<h4>Model Evaluation:</h4>
The performance of CaptionCraft is rigorously evaluated using the BLEU-4 metric, which assesses the similarity between generated captions and ground truth references. By comparing the generated captions against human-labeled captions from the SCICAP dataset, CaptionCraft quantifies its ability to produce accurate and contextually relevant descriptions for scientific figures. The evaluation results provide insights into the efficacy of the model and its potential for real-world applications in scientific communication.

<h4>Results and Interpretation:</h4>
CaptionCraft achieves a benchmark BLEU-4 score of 0.411, indicating a high level of accuracy in generating captions for scientific figures. The evaluation highlights the effectiveness of the model architecture and training strategies in capturing the nuances of scientific visuals and producing informative descriptions. The interpretation of results underscores the potential of CaptionCraft to streamline the process of captioning scientific figures, thereby facilitating knowledge dissemination and fostering collaboration within the scientific community.

<h4>Conclusion:</h4>
In conclusion, CaptionCraft represents a significant advancement in the field of scientific figure captioning, offering a robust solution for automating the generation of descriptive captions for complex visual data. Through a combination of cutting-edge techniques in computer vision and natural language processing, CaptionCraft demonstrates the potential to revolutionize scientific communication and knowledge dissemination. By leveraging the SCICAP dataset and state-of-the-art model architecture, CaptionCraft lays the foundation for future innovations in scientific figure captioning, paving the way for enhanced collaboration and discovery in the scientific community.
